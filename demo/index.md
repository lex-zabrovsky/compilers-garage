# Welcome to The Monospace Web

Monospace fonts are dear to many of us. Some find them more readable, consistent, and beautiful, than their proportional alternatives. Maybe we're just brainwashed from spending years in terminals? Or are we hopelessly nostalgic? I'm not sure. But I like them, and that's why I started experimenting with all-monospace Web.

On this page, I use a monospace grid to align text and draw diagrams. It's generated from a simple Markdown document (using Pandoc), and the CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript renders it on the grid. The page is responsive, shrinking in character-sized steps. Standard elements should _just work_, at least that's the goal. It's semantic HTML, rendered as if we were back in the 70s.

All right, but is this even a good idea? It's a technical and creative challenge and I like the aesthetic. If you'd like to use it, feel free to fork or copy the bits you need, respecting the license. I might update it over time with improvements and support for more standard elements.
